# Grunt Project Skeleton

This is a Sample grunt project skeleton which I use for my personal stuff. It is generally for small static websites. 


It has a few grunt modules install and pre-configured out-of-the-box. 

* Pug (formerly Jade)
* Sass - CSS preprocessor I tend to favour. 
* Basic FTP module for deploying your stuff to a server
* A few other basic npm modules which support the building of a 'dist' version of a website.
